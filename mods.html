        <div class="title">To Begin</div>
        <div class="headtext">My 1991 Toyota MR2 has had little modifications due to it needing lots of basics fixed, as
            well as maintenance. I also am not looking to spend thousands on changing the car, such as body-kits and
            engine modifications</div>

        <div class="title1">Head Unit</div>
        <div class="wrapper1">
            When i bought the car, it had a really old fashioned head unit, that i was unable to connect my phone to. I
            bought a $600 kenwood double din headunit from supercheap auto and installed it.

        <div class="title2">Steering Wheel</div>
        <div class="wrapper2">
            I really like the design of my steering wheel so I'm not looking to buy an aftermarket removeable one,
            atleast not for a while. The stock steering wheel had lots of wear and unevenness, so i sanded and filled
            the wheel to make it smooth, then sewed a leather cover on.

        <div class="title2">Exhaust</div>
        <div class="wrapper2">
            I spent about 4 hours working on restoring my exhaust. I begun by removing it and found that there was a
            small hole near my muffler, as well as rusty bolts holding it on. I wetsanded from 400 inccrementally up to
            2000 grit and then polished with a random orbital machine.

        <div class="title2">Shifter and Shift Boot</div>
        <div class="wrapper2">
            When I first bought my car, the plastic surrounding the shifter was cracked, so I patched and resprayed it
            (no image). The original shifter and boot was very worn and I wasn't the biggest fan. I bought a heavy
            weight, "LikeWise" shifter, as well as sewed my own custom shift boot.

        <div class="title2">Wheels and Coilovers</div>
        <div class="wrapper2">
            The wheels that came with the car were 17inch Enkei Sc03, with very uevenly worn re003 tyres, gutter rash
            and bad fitment. I ordered custom SSR SP1R wheels from AutoTechnik, which took 6 months to arrive from
            Japan. I had to install BC coilovers to fit the wheels due to their wider sizing. The car's fenders also
            needed to be rolled so the wheels wouldnt rub as bad.
